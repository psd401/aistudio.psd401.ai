# Knowledge Repository Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a comprehensive knowledge repository system with document processing, embedding generation, and semantic search capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Admin Repository System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create repository management pages
- [x] Database schema for repositories and items
- [x] CRUD operations for repositories
- [x] Repository access control
- [x] Basic UI for repository management

### Phase 2: File Processing Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] S3 integration for document storage
- [x] File upload with presigned URLs
- [x] Lambda function for text extraction
- [x] Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- [x] Text chunking and storage
- [x] Processing status tracking
- [x] Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Embeddings & Vector Search ✅ COMPLETED

#### Completed Features
- [x] Embedding configuration in database settings
- [x] AI helpers integration for embedding generation
- [x] Embedding generator Lambda function
- [x] SQS queue for embedding processing
- [x] PostgreSQL array storage for vectors
- [x] Processing status updates (processing_embeddings, embedded, embedding_failed)
- [x] UI updates to show embedding status
- [x] Vector similarity search with cosine similarity
- [x] Keyword search using PostgreSQL full-text search
- [x] Hybrid search combining both approaches
- [x] Search UI with advanced options
  - [x] Search type selection (semantic/keyword/hybrid)
  - [x] Adjustable semantic weight slider
  - [x] Result relevance scoring
  - [x] Highlighted matching text
- [x] Error handling and NaN fixes
- [x] End-to-end testing successful

#### Optional Future Enhancements
- [ ] Backfill embeddings for existing content
- [ ] Add embedding model comparison
- [ ] Optimize chunk sizes for search quality
- [ ] Add search filters (date ranges, document types)
- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets

### Phase 4: Tool Integration (Future)
- [ ] Connect repositories to AI tools
- [ ] Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- [ ] Tool-specific repository access
- [ ] Usage analytics and insights

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Multi-modal embeddings (images, tables)
- [ ] Incremental updates for changed documents
- [ ] Repository versioning and history
- [ ] Collaborative annotations
- [ ] Export and sharing capabilities

## Technical Stack

### Current Implementation
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for documents
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with array support for vectors
- **Processing**: AWS Lambda + SQS for async processing
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (configurable)
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Server Actions
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for IaC

### Upcoming Technologies
- **Vector Search**: PostgreSQL arrays with custom similarity functions (or pgvector)
- **Search Engine**: Hybrid approach with full-text and vector search
- **Caching**: Redis for embedding cache (if needed)

## Progress Summary

### What's Working
- ✅ Complete document upload and processing pipeline
- ✅ Text extraction from multiple file formats
- ✅ Intelligent text chunking
- ✅ Embedding generation with multiple AI providers
- ✅ Proper status tracking through the entire pipeline
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ UI real-time updates
- ✅ Vector similarity search with cosine similarity
- ✅ Keyword search with PostgreSQL full-text
- ✅ Hybrid search with configurable weights
- ✅ Advanced search UI with multiple options

### Recent Achievements
- Implemented complete search infrastructure
- Created intuitive search UI with advanced options
- Fixed NaN display issues in search results
- Successfully tested semantic, keyword, and hybrid search
- Achieved sub-second search performance
- Search results show relevance scores and highlighted matches

### Phase 3 Completion
All core search functionality is now operational:
- Users can search repositories using natural language
- System finds semantically similar content even without exact matches
- Hybrid mode balances semantic understanding with keyword precision
- Clean, responsive UI provides excellent user experience

## Notes
- Phase 3 completed as of 2025-07-26
- Embedding infrastructure fully operational
- Using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
- Search functionality tested and working:
  - Vector similarity search using cosine similarity
  - Keyword search using PostgreSQL full-text search
  - Hybrid search with configurable semantic/keyword weights
- Performance: Sub-second search responses
- Ready for Phase 4: Tool Integration
