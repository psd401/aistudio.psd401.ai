# Knowledge Repository Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a comprehensive knowledge repository system with document processing, embedding generation, and semantic search capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Admin Repository System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create repository management pages
- [x] Database schema for repositories and items
- [x] CRUD operations for repositories
- [x] Repository access control
- [x] Basic UI for repository management

### Phase 2: File Processing Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] S3 integration for document storage
- [x] File upload with presigned URLs
- [x] Lambda function for text extraction
- [x] Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- [x] Text chunking and storage
- [x] Processing status tracking
- [x] Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Embeddings & Vector Search ⚡ IN PROGRESS

#### Completed ✅
- [x] Embedding configuration in database settings
- [x] AI helpers integration for embedding generation
- [x] Embedding generator Lambda function
- [x] SQS queue for embedding processing
- [x] PostgreSQL array storage for vectors
- [x] Processing status updates (processing_embeddings, embedded, embedding_failed)
- [x] UI updates to show embedding status
- [x] End-to-end testing with OpenAI embeddings
- [x] Documentation and commit

#### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] **Vector Similarity Search** (Next)
  - [ ] Create search endpoint with vector similarity
  - [ ] Implement pgvector extension or native PostgreSQL operations
  - [ ] Add relevance scoring and ranking
  - [ ] Create search API endpoints
  
- [ ] **Hybrid Search**
  - [ ] Combine keyword search with semantic search
  - [ ] Implement result merging and re-ranking
  - [ ] Add search filters (repository, date, type)
  
- [ ] **Search UI**
  - [ ] Create search interface component
  - [ ] Display search results with snippets
  - [ ] Add pagination and filtering
  - [ ] Show relevance scores
  
- [ ] **Backfill & Optimization**
  - [ ] Backfill embeddings for existing content
  - [ ] Add embedding model comparison
  - [ ] Optimize chunk sizes for search quality

### Phase 4: Tool Integration (Future)
- [ ] Connect repositories to AI tools
- [ ] Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- [ ] Tool-specific repository access
- [ ] Usage analytics and insights

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Multi-modal embeddings (images, tables)
- [ ] Incremental updates for changed documents
- [ ] Repository versioning and history
- [ ] Collaborative annotations
- [ ] Export and sharing capabilities

## Technical Stack

### Current Implementation
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for documents
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with array support for vectors
- **Processing**: AWS Lambda + SQS for async processing
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (configurable)
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Server Actions
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for IaC

### Upcoming Technologies
- **Vector Search**: PostgreSQL arrays with custom similarity functions (or pgvector)
- **Search Engine**: Hybrid approach with full-text and vector search
- **Caching**: Redis for embedding cache (if needed)

## Progress Summary

### What's Working
- ✅ Complete document upload and processing pipeline
- ✅ Text extraction from multiple file formats
- ✅ Intelligent text chunking
- ✅ Embedding generation with multiple AI providers
- ✅ Proper status tracking through the entire pipeline
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ UI real-time updates

### Recent Achievements
- Fixed PostgreSQL array type casting for embeddings
- Resolved RDS Data API BatchExecuteStatement limitations
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Added support for all embedding processing statuses in UI
- Successfully processed test document with 26 chunks × 1536 dimensions

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement vector similarity search endpoint
2. Create search UI component
3. Test search quality and relevance
4. Optimize for performance

## Notes
- Embedding infrastructure is fully operational as of 2025-07-26
- Using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
- All 26 test chunks successfully embedded
- Ready for vector search implementation
