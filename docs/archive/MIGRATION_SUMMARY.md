# Assistant Architect Frontend Migration Summary

## Migration from Mixed Execution to Universal Polling Architecture

### What Changed

#### Removed Mixed Execution Paths
- ✅ Removed `useChat` hook entirely (no local streaming)
- ✅ Removed `sendMessage`, `messages`, `setMessages` state
- ✅ Removed dual execution paths between streaming and polling
- ✅ Removed complex streaming logic with useChat integration

#### Updated to Universal Polling
- ✅ Single execution path: job creation → polling → results
- ✅ Added `streamingJob`, `jobStatus`, `partialContent` state
- ✅ Pure job polling via `getStreamingJobAction` with fallback to legacy `getJobAction`
- ✅ Adaptive polling intervals based on job status
- ✅ Progressive streaming display from job `partialContent`

#### New State Management
```typescript
// Before: Mixed state
const { messages, sendMessage, status, stop } = useChat()
const [results, setResults] = useState()
const [isPolling, setIsPolling] = useState()

// After: Unified polling state  
const [streamingJob, setStreamingJob] = useState<StreamingJob | null>(null)
const [jobStatus, setJobStatus] = useState<UniversalPollingStatus>('pending') 
const [partialContent, setPartialContent] = useState<string>('')
const [isPolling, setIsPolling] = useState(false)
```

#### Execution Flow Changes

**Before:**
1. Submit form → executeAssistantArchitectAction()
2. If supports streaming: useChat.sendMessage() + streaming display
3. If legacy: poll getJobAction() + prompt results display
4. Two different result display paths

**After:**
1. Submit form → executeAssistantArchitectAction()
2. Always: Start polling with jobId
3. Poll getStreamingJobAction() (with fallback to getJobAction())
4. Single result display showing streaming progress
5. Show final results when completed

#### UI Display Changes
- ✅ Single result display path showing job progress
- ✅ Progressive streaming from `partialContent` 
- ✅ Consistent loading states and progress indicators
- ✅ Universal job status display (pending/processing/streaming/completed/failed/cancelled)
- ✅ Real job cancellation via `cancelStreamingJobAction`

#### New Server Actions
- ✅ Created `/actions/db/streaming-job-actions.ts`
- ✅ `getStreamingJobAction()` - Get streaming job by ID
- ✅ `cancelStreamingJobAction()` - Cancel streaming job

#### Polling Implementation
- ✅ Hybrid polling: Try streaming jobs first, fallback to legacy jobs
- ✅ Status-based polling intervals (pending: 2s, processing: 3s, streaming: 1.5s)
- ✅ Proper cleanup and abort controller usage
- ✅ Timeout handling with MAX_RETRIES

### Benefits of Universal Polling

1. **Consistency**: Same execution path for all Assistant Architect tools
2. **Reliability**: No mixed state management between streaming and polling
3. **Scalability**: Works with Lambda workers and SQS queues
4. **Maintainability**: Single code path, easier debugging
5. **Future-proof**: Ready for full streaming job architecture

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Legacy jobs still work via fallback polling
- ✅ Existing prompt results display preserved
- ✅ Chat functionality preserved for completed executions
- ✅ All existing UI functionality maintained

### Technical Implementation

The migration maintains the same user experience while moving to a cleaner, more reliable architecture:

- **Job Creation**: `executeAssistantArchitectAction()` returns `jobId`
- **Status Polling**: Hybrid approach checking streaming jobs first, legacy second
- **Progress Display**: Single path showing `partialContent` → `responseData.text`
- **Error Handling**: Unified error states and messaging
- **Cancellation**: Real job cancellation through server actions

This puts the Assistant Architect frontend on the same universal polling foundation as Nexus Chat, Model Compare, and other modern features.
