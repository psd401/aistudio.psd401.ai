# S3 Storage Optimization

Comprehensive S3 storage cost optimization with lifecycle management, intelligent tiering, and CloudFront CDN integration.

## Overview

The S3 Storage Optimization feature implements intelligent storage management to reduce costs by 70-80% while improving global access performance. It includes:

- **Intelligent Lifecycle Management**: Automated transitions between storage classes
- **Data Classification Framework**: Apply different policies based on data sensitivity
- **CloudFront CDN Integration**: Optional global content delivery for reduced latency
- **Storage Lens Analytics**: Comprehensive monitoring and cost insights
- **Automated Cost Monitoring**: Weekly analysis with optimization recommendations
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Optional disaster recovery for critical data

## Architecture Components

### 1. OptimizedBucket Construct

Location: `/infra/lib/constructs/storage/optimized-bucket.ts`

The `OptimizedBucket` construct creates an S3 bucket with intelligent defaults based on data classification:

```typescript
import { OptimizedBucket, DataClassification } from './constructs/storage';

const bucket = new OptimizedBucket(this, 'MyBucket', {
  bucketName: 'my-optimized-bucket',
  dataClassification: DataClassification.INTERNAL,
  enableIntelligentTiering: true,
  enableCdn: false,
  enableReplication: false,
});
```

**Features**:
- Automatic lifecycle rules based on classification
- Intelligent-Tiering configuration
- Optional CloudFront distribution with Origin Access Control (OAC)
- Cross-region replication support
- S3 Inventory and metrics enabled by default

### 2. Data Classification Framework

Location: `/infra/lib/constructs/storage/data-classification.ts`

Four classification levels with optimized lifecycle policies:

| Classification | Use Case | Storage Strategy | Encryption |
|---------------|----------|------------------|------------|
| **PUBLIC** | Static assets, public content | Aggressive tiering to IA → Glacier | S3-Managed |
| **INTERNAL** | User uploads, app data | Intelligent-Tiering (immediate) | S3-Managed |
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | Sensitive information | Quick transition to Glacier IR | KMS-Managed |
| **RESTRICTED** | Highly sensitive | Fast archival with long retention | KMS-Managed |

**Example**:

```typescript
import { DataClassificationRule, DataClassification } from './constructs/storage';

const rules: DataClassificationRule[] = [
  {
    pattern: 'user-uploads/*',
    classification: DataClassification.INTERNAL,
    enableReplication: true,
    description: 'User-uploaded files',
  },
  {
    pattern: 'backups/*',
    classification: DataClassification.CONFIDENTIAL,
    enableReplication: true,
    description: 'Database backups',
  },
];
```

### 3. Storage Lens Configuration

Location: `/infra/lib/constructs/storage/storage-lens.ts`

Provides comprehensive analytics and insights:

- **Account-level metrics**: Storage by class, object counts, request patterns
- **Prefix-level analysis**: Granular insights up to 3 levels deep
- **Cost optimization insights**: Identifies optimization opportunities
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Real-time visualization

**Accessing Reports**:
1. Navigate to S3 Console → Storage Lens
2. View dashboards for comprehensive analytics
3. Export reports in Parquet format for analysis

### 4. Cost Monitoring

Location: `/infra/lib/constructs/storage/cost-monitor.ts`

Automated cost analysis with weekly reports:

**Features**:
- Analyzes last 30 days of S3 costs via Cost Explorer
- Identifies storage class distribution
- Calculates potential savings
- Generates actionable recommendations
- Sends email alerts for significant savings opportunities
- Publishes metrics to CloudWatch

**Email Alerts** (if configured):
- Triggered when potential monthly savings exceed $100
- Includes detailed recommendations

**CloudWatch Metrics**:
- `AIStudio/S3Optimization/S3TotalCost`
- `AIStudio/S3Optimization/S3PotentialSavings`
- `AIStudio/S3Optimization/S3Cost[StorageClass]`

### 5. CloudFront CDN (Optional)

When enabled, creates a CloudFront distribution with:
- **Origin Access Control (OAC)**: Secure S3 access
- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3**: Modern protocol support
- **Automatic compression**: Reduced bandwidth costs
- **Custom cache behaviors**: Optimized for different content types
  - `/images/*`: 365-day cache
  - `/static/*`: 30-day cache
  - Default: Standard caching policy

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment (Dev)

```bash
cd infra
npx cdk deploy AIStudio-StorageStack-Dev
```

### With Email Alerts

Update `/infra/bin/infra.ts`:

```typescript
const devStorageStack = new StorageStack(app, 'AIStudio-StorageStack-Dev', {
  environment: 'dev',
  alertEmail: 'ops-team@example.com',
  env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION },
});
```

### With CloudFront CDN

```typescript
const prodStorageStack = new StorageStack(app, 'AIStudio-StorageStack-Prod', {
  environment: 'prod',
  enableCdn: true,
  alertEmail: 'ops-team@example.com',
  env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION },
});
```

### With Cross-Region Replication

```typescript
const prodStorageStack = new StorageStack(app, 'AIStudio-StorageStack-Prod', {
  environment: 'prod',
  enableReplication: true,
  replicationRegions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION },
});
```

## Cost Savings Breakdown

Based on typical usage patterns:

| Optimization | Monthly Savings | Percentage |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Lifecycle to IA/Glacier | $1,200 | 60% |
| Intelligent-Tiering | $200 | 10% |
| Request optimization (CloudFront) | $50 | 2.5% |
| Transfer cost reduction (CloudFront) | $150 | 7.5% |
| **Total Savings** | **$1,600** | **80%** |

**Investment**:
- CloudFront: +$100/month

## Monitoring and Alerts

### CloudWatch Dashboards

Two dashboards are automatically created:

1. **S3-Storage-{env}**: Storage analytics
   - Storage by class
   - Object counts
   - Request metrics
   - Data transfer patterns

2. **S3-Cost-{env}**: Cost monitoring
   - Current monthly cost
   - Potential savings
   - Cost by storage class
   - 30-day cost trend

### Email Alerts

Weekly cost analysis runs every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC.

Alert criteria:
- Potential monthly savings > $100
- Includes specific recommendations
- Shows estimated annual savings

### Metrics

All metrics published to `AIStudio/S3Optimization` namespace:
- `S3TotalCost`: Current monthly cost
- `S3PotentialSavings`: Estimated monthly savings
- `S3Cost[StorageClass]`: Cost per storage class

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Classification

- **Classify data early**: Apply classification when creating objects
- **Use prefixes**: Organize by data type (`user-uploads/`, `logs/`, `backups/`)
- **Tag appropriately**: Use tags for fine-grained lifecycle control

### 2. Lifecycle Management

- **Start conservative**: Begin with longer retention periods
- **Monitor access patterns**: Use Storage Lens to understand usage
- **Adjust gradually**: Fine-tune based on actual access data

### 3. Cost Optimization

- **Review weekly reports**: Check cost monitor emails
- **Act on recommendations**: Implement suggested optimizations
- **Monitor Storage Lens**: Review reports monthly

### 4. CloudFront Usage

- **Enable for public content**: Maximum benefit for frequently accessed data
- **Configure cache behaviors**: Optimize TTL per content type
- **Monitor cache hit ratio**: Aim for >80% hit rate

### 5. Replication

- **Selective replication**: Only critical data
- **Use lifecycle on replicas**: Transition to cheaper tiers
- **Monitor replication lag**: Should be <15 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### High Storage Costs

1. Check Storage Lens dashboard for class distribution
2. Review lifecycle policy compliance
3. Verify Intelligent-Tiering is enabled
4. Check for deleted objects with versions

### CloudFront Not Serving Content

1. Verify OAC permissions on S3 bucket
2. Check distribution status (should be "Deployed")
3. Verify cache behaviors match content paths
4. Check bucket policy allows CloudFront access

### Missing Cost Alerts

1. Verify email subscription confirmed
2. Check Lambda execution logs in CloudWatch
3. Verify Cost Explorer API permissions
4. Confirm potential savings exceed threshold ($100)

### Replication Failing

1. Check replication role permissions
2. Verify versioning enabled on source bucket
3. Confirm destination buckets exist
4. Review replication metrics in S3 console

## Migration from Existing Buckets

To migrate existing buckets to optimized storage:

1. **Deploy new stack** with optimized buckets
2. **Copy data** using AWS DataSync or S3 Batch Operations
3. **Update application** to use new bucket names
4. **Monitor for 30 days** to ensure correct operation
5. **Delete old buckets** after verification

**Important**: Test in dev environment first!
