- **Multiple Tools**: Combine tools when tasks require both current data and computation
- **Sequential Prompts**: Use different tools across multiple prompts for complex workflows
- **Performance**: Consider execution time when using multiple tools (aim for <30 seconds total)

### Writing Effective Tool-Enabled Prompts

#### Web Search Prompts
```markdown
# Good Example
"Search for the current stock price of Tesla (TSLA) and compare it to its price 6 months ago. Analyze the trend and major factors affecting the change."

# Poor Example
"What is Tesla?" (too general, doesn't require current data)
```

#### Code Interpreter Prompts
```markdown
# Good Example
"Calculate the monthly payment for a $300,000 mortgage at 6.5% interest over 30 years. Show the calculation steps and create an amortization table for the first year."

# Poor Example
"What is 2 + 2?" (too simple for code interpreter)
```

#### Combined Tools Example
```markdown
"Search for the latest quarterly earnings data for Apple and Microsoft. Then calculate and visualize the revenue growth rates for both companies over the past 4 quarters."
```

## Performance Considerations

### Execution Times
- **Target**: Assistants should complete within 30 seconds
- **Web Search**: Typically adds 5-15 seconds to execution
- **Code Interpreter**: Typically adds 3-10 seconds depending on complexity
- **Multiple Tools**: May execute in parallel when possible

### Optimization Tips
- Write specific, focused prompts to minimize tool usage time
- Avoid redundant web searches within the same execution
- Use code interpreter for complex calculations, not simple arithmetic
- Test your assistants regularly to ensure consistent performance

### Success Rate Expectations
- **Target**: >95% successful execution rate
- Failed executions are typically due to:
  - Network connectivity issues
  - API rate limiting
  - Overly complex or ambiguous prompts
  - Timeout due to long-running computations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No tools available for this model"
- **Cause**: Selected model doesn't support tools
- **Solution**: Switch to GPT-5, GPT-4o, or Gemini Pro model

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling
- Web search results are processed securely and not stored permanently
- Code execution happens in isolated environments
- No personal data is sent to external tool services
- All tool usage is logged for monitoring and debugging

### 🔒 Critical Security Guidelines

#### Prompt Security & Data Protection
- **⚠️ NEVER include sensitive data** in prompts that use tools:
  - Personal identification numbers (SSN, license numbers)
  - Financial information (credit card numbers, bank accounts)
  - Authentication credentials (passwords, API keys)
  - Proprietary business information or trade secrets
  - Patient health information or other regulated data
- **External API Risk**: Web search tools send prompts to external services - treat all prompts as potentially visible to third parties
- **Data Locality**: Tool execution may process data in different geographic regions - ensure compliance with data residency requirements
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit, but external tool providers have their own security policies

#### Output Validation & Verification
- **🔍 ALWAYS verify tool results** before using in critical decisions:
  - Web search results may contain outdated or inaccurate information
  - Code interpreter calculations should be independently verified for financial or safety-critical applications
  - Cross-reference important information with authoritative sources
- **Misinformation Risk**: AI-generated summaries may introduce bias or errors - verify facts independently
- **Code Security**: Review all generated code before execution in production environments
- **Business Decisions**: Never rely solely on tool outputs for important business or operational decisions

#### Access Control & Monitoring
- **Activity Logging**: All tool usage is logged and monitored for security purposes:
  - Execution timestamps and user identification
  - Input prompts and generated outputs (sanitized for sensitive data)
  - Performance metrics and error conditions
  - Security violation attempts and rate limiting events
- **Access Reviews**: Tool access permissions are reviewed regularly by system administrators
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail maintained for compliance and security investigation purposes
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual usage patterns are automatically flagged for security review

#### Data Retention & Lifecycle
- **Execution History**: Tool execution data is retained according to the following schedule:
  - **Active Data**: 30 days in primary systems for performance monitoring
  - **Archived Data**: 90 days in secure archive for audit and compliance
  - **Automatic Cleanup**: All tool execution data automatically deleted after retention period
  - **Security Logs**: Security-related logs retained for 1 year minimum
- **User Control**: Users can request deletion of their tool execution history (subject to legal/compliance requirements)
- **Backup Policy**: Encrypted backups follow same retention schedule with secure destruction

#### Network Security & Isolation
- **Tool Isolation**: Each tool execution runs in a completely isolated environment
- **Network Restrictions**:
  - Code interpreter has NO internet access
  - Web search limited to approved, safe domains only
  - All network traffic monitored and filtered
- **Data Boundaries**: No tool can access data from other users or executions

### Best Practices for Secure Usage
