### Operations

#### [operations/OPERATIONS.md](./operations/OPERATIONS.md)
Operational procedures, monitoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Developers
1. Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the system
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md#streaming-architecture-evolution](./ARCHITECTURE.md#streaming-architecture-evolution) for the streaming system
3. Review [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) for setup
4. Follow [guides/TYPESCRIPT.md](./guides/TYPESCRIPT.md) for code standards
5. Reference [guides/LOGGING.md](./guides/LOGGING.md) for logging patterns

### For DevOps/Infrastructure
1. Follow [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for initial deployment
2. Study [operations/streaming-infrastructure.md](./operations/streaming-infrastructure.md) for ECS streaming operations
3. Review [operations/OPERATIONS.md](./operations/OPERATIONS.md) for maintenance
4. Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#infrastructure) for infrastructure details

### For Testing
1. Read [guides/TESTING.md](./guides/TESTING.md) for testing strategies
2. Use Playwright MCP for E2E testing during development
3. Add tests to `working-tests.spec.ts` for CI/CD

## üìñ Key Concepts

### ActionState Pattern
All server actions return a consistent response structure. See [ARCHITECTURE.md#actionstate-pattern](./ARCHITECTURE.md#actionstate-pattern).

### Provider Factory
Unified interface for multiple AI providers. See [API/AI_SDK_PATTERNS.md](./API/AI_SDK_PATTERNS.md#provider-factory-pattern).

### Request Tracing
Every operation gets a unique request ID for end-to-end tracing. See [guides/LOGGING.md](./guides/LOGGING.md#request-tracing).

### Settings Management
Database-first configuration with environment fallback. See [ARCHITECTURE.md#settings-management](./ARCHITECTURE.md#settings-management).

### ECS Streaming Architecture
Direct ECS execution for real-time AI streaming with HTTP/2 support. See [ARCHITECTURE.md#streaming-architecture-evolution](./ARCHITECTURE.md#streaming-architecture-evolution).

### AI Streaming Core Package
Shared provider abstraction for consistent AI integration. See [features/ai-streaming-core-package.md](./features/ai-streaming-core-package.md).

## üîß Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Design the database schema
2. Create server actions with proper logging
3. Build UI components
4. Add E2E tests
5. Update documentation

### Adding a New AI Provider
1. Follow [guides/adding-ai-providers.md](./guides/adding-ai-providers.md)
2. Create provider adapter in AI SDK provider factory
3. Add to database models and configuration
4. Test with real API and update monitoring
5. Deploy and verify in staging environment

### Debugging Production Issues
1. Use request ID to trace through CloudWatch logs
2. Check error codes in application logs
3. Review [operations/OPERATIONS.md](./operations/OPERATIONS.md) for procedures

### Deploying Updates
1. Test locally with `npm run dev`
2. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`
3. Deploy with CDK: `npx cdk deploy`
4. Monitor CloudWatch for errors

### Deploying Background Lambdas
For Lambda functions used for background processing (document processing, embeddings):
1. Build and package Lambda functions in `/infra/lambdas/`
2. Deploy via CDK: `npx cdk deploy AIStudio-ProcessingStack-Dev`
3. Verify function logs in CloudWatch
4. Note: AI streaming is handled by ECS, not Lambda

2. Use clear, concise language
3. Include code examples
4. Update the table of contents
5. Archive outdated documentation

### File Organization
- Current, active documentation stays in main folders
- Completed implementations move to `archive/implementations/`
- Completed plans move to `archive/planning/`
- Outdated versions move to `archive/` with descriptive names

## ü§ù Contributing

When contributing to documentation:
