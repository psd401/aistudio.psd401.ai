# Testing Assistant Architect with AI SDK v2

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Test Assistant Architect Execution
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/tools/assistant-architect
2. Select a model (e.g., GPT-4o)
3. Enter a test task: "Create a simple React component for a button"
4. Click "Execute"
5. Verify:
   - Execution starts successfully
   - Progress is shown
   - Results are displayed

### 2. Test Follow-up Chat
1. After execution completes, look for the "Follow-up" chat section
2. Enter a follow-up question: "Can you explain the button component?"
3. Verify:
   - Message sends successfully
   - Response streams back using the selected model
   - Context from execution is maintained

### 3. Test Conversation Persistence
1. Navigate away from the page
2. Return to the same execution
3. Verify chat history is preserved

## Expected Behaviors

### With AI SDK v2 Updates:
- ✅ Chat uses default `/api/chat` route (not `stream-final`)
- ✅ Messages stream with proper status states ('ready', 'submitted', 'streaming')
- ✅ Model selection works correctly
- ✅ Execution context is passed through body parameters
- ✅ Conversation ID is handled via response headers

## Success Criteria
- No console errors about missing routes
- No TypeScript errors
- Chat functionality works seamlessly
- Context is maintained between execution and chat
