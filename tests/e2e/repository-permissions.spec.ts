    Repository Permission Test Scenarios:
    
    1. Public Repository Access Control:
       - User A creates a public repository
       - User B should be able to VIEW the repository
       - User B should NOT be able to EDIT the repository
       - User B should NOT be able to DELETE the repository
       - User B should NOT be able to ADD items to the repository
    
    2. Private Repository Access Control:
       - User A creates a private repository
       - User B should NOT be able to view the repository in their list
       - Assistant created by User A should be able to use the private repository
       - Assistant used by User B should still access User A's private repository if A created the assistant
    
    3. Repository Owner Permissions:
       - Owner can update repository name, description, and visibility
       - Owner can add documents, URLs, and text items
       - Owner can remove items from their repository
       - Owner can delete their repository
    
    4. Administrator Override:
       - Admin can view all repositories (public and private)
       - Admin can edit any repository
       - Admin can delete any repository
       - Admin can manage items in any repository
       - Admin actions should be logged for audit purposes
    
    5. Form Field Fix Verification:
       - Creating a repository with public/private toggle should work
       - Editing a repository's visibility should persist correctly
       - The isPublic field should update in the database
    
    6. Assistant Knowledge Repository Access:
       - Assistant can access public repositories
       - Assistant can access private repositories owned by the assistant creator
       - Assistant cannot access private repositories not owned by the creator
       - Follow-up conversations should maintain repository access

# Playwright MCP Test Examples

## Test 1: Verify non-owner cannot edit public repository
/e2e-test Login as User A and create a public repository named "Test Public Repo"
/e2e-test Logout and login as User B
/e2e-test Navigate to /repositories and verify "Test Public Repo" is visible
/e2e-test Click on "Test Public Repo" and verify there is no Edit button
/e2e-test Try to navigate directly to /repositories/[id]/edit and verify access is denied

## Test 2: Verify repository visibility toggle works
/e2e-test Login as User A and navigate to /repositories/new
/e2e-test Fill in repository name "Visibility Test"
/e2e-test Toggle the "Public Repository" switch to ON
/e2e-test Submit the form and verify repository is created
/e2e-test Navigate to the repository and click Edit
/e2e-test Verify the "Public Repository" switch is ON
/e2e-test Toggle it to OFF and save
/e2e-test Verify the repository now shows as "Private"

## Test 3: Verify admin can manage all repositories
/e2e-test Login as an administrator
/e2e-test Navigate to /admin/repositories
/e2e-test Verify all repositories are listed with owner information
/e2e-test Click Actions menu on any repository not owned by admin
/e2e-test Verify Edit, Delete, and Manage Items options are available
/e2e-test Click Edit and change the repository name
/e2e-test Verify the change is saved successfully

## Test 4: Verify assistant can use creator's private repository
/e2e-test Login as User A and create a private repository "Private Knowledge"
/e2e-test Add some documents to the repository
/e2e-test Create an assistant and configure it to use "Private Knowledge" repository
/e2e-test Publish the assistant
/e2e-test Login as User B
/e2e-test Use User A's assistant and ask about content from "Private Knowledge"
/e2e-test Verify the assistant can access and use the private repository content
