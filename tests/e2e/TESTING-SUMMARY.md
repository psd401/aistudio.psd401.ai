# E2E Testing Summary for AI Studio

## Current Status

### âœ… What Works

1. **Public Page Tests**
   - Route protection (redirects to sign-in)
   - Sign-in page display
   - Basic page loading

2. **Playwright MCP Testing**
   - Full application testing using your browser session
   - All authenticated features accessible
   - Visual, interactive testing

### ðŸš§ Authentication Challenge

The application uses AWS Cognito with Google OAuth, which creates complexity for automated testing:
- Real OAuth flow is difficult to automate
- Dev environment uses automatic mock authentication
- Session management is handled by NextAuth

## Recommended Testing Approach

### 1. For Development & QA (Use Playwright MCP)

Test all features interactively using Claude Code:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# In Claude Code, use commands like:
/e2e-test Test user management at /admin/users
/e2e-test Test chat functionality at /chat
/e2e-test Test model comparison at /compare
```

**Benefits:**
- No authentication hassles
- Visual feedback
- Rapid iteration
- Tests real user workflows

### 2. For CI/CD (Use Basic Tests)

Run tests that don't require authentication:

```bash
npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/working-tests.spec.ts
```

**What's Tested:**
- Route protection
- Public pages
- Basic UI structure

## File Structure

```
tests/e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ working-tests.spec.ts         # Tests that actually pass
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright-mcp-examples.md    # Guide for MCP testing
â”œâ”€â”€ README-PLAYWRIGHT-MCP.md      # Detailed strategy
â”œâ”€â”€ TESTING-SUMMARY.md           # This file
â””â”€â”€ TEST_COVERAGE.md             # Comprehensive test scenarios
```

## Key Insights

1. **Don't Fight the Auth System**: Instead of complex OAuth automation, use Playwright MCP for authenticated testing

2. **Focus on What Works**: CI/CD tests verify basic functionality; manual testing covers complex workflows

3. **Document Everything**: Clear guides ensure anyone can run tests effectively

## Next Steps

When you need full automated testing:

1. **Option A**: Implement test-specific authentication bypass
2. **Option B**: Create dedicated test Cognito pool with simpler auth
3. **Option C**: Use API testing for backend verification

## Running Tests

### Quick Test
```bash
# Run working tests
npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/working-tests.spec.ts
```

### Interactive Testing
```bash
# Use Claude Code with Playwright MCP
# Already logged in, test any feature!
```

This pragmatic approach gives you:
- âœ… Immediate testing capability
- âœ… No blocked tests
- âœ… Clear path forward
- âœ… Actual working tests in CI/CD
