# Performance Tests - CI/CD Configuration

## Important: These tests are SKIPPED in CI by default

Performance tests require:
- Running API server
- Authentication configuration  
- 30+ minutes execution time

They are **automatically skipped in CI environments** unless explicitly enabled.

## To run in CI

Set environment variable:
```bash
RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=true
```

## Local Development

Tests run normally in local development (not skipped).

## Test Pattern

All test files use this pattern:
```typescript
const describeOrSkip = shouldSkipPerformanceTests() ? describe.skip : describe;

describeOrSkip('Test Suite', () => {
  // tests
});
```

This ensures CI jobs complete quickly without hanging.
